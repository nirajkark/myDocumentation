    The Cultural Heritage Linked Open Data (CHLOD) Ontology is a comprehensive semantic framework designed to digitize, organize, and interlink cultural heritage data. Built upon established standards such as the PROV Ontology and adapted from the CIDOC CRM Ontology, CHLOD aims to provide an interoperable and detailed structure for representing cultural artifacts, historical sites, and their associated activities, agents, and events.  
  
    <strong>Motivation:</strong> CHLOD addresses the growing need for preserving cultural heritage digitally. It aims to mitigate the loss of cultural information due to natural disasters, human neglect, or insufficient documentation while promoting its accessibility to researchers, educators, and the general public.  
  
    <strong>State of the Art:</strong> By adapting and extending the CIDOC CRM Ontology—a widely recognized standard for cultural heritage documentation—CHLOD ensures robust compatibility with international frameworks. Combined with the PROV Ontology, it enables comprehensive provenance tracking of artifacts and events.  
  
    <strong>Goals:</strong> The primary objectives of the CHLOD Ontology are:  
    - To preserve and document cultural heritage through structured digital frameworks.  
    - To enable interoperability with global datasets for enhanced research and educational use.  
    - To support applications in tourism, virtual experiences, and artificial intelligence by providing standardized semantic data.  
  
    The CHLOD Ontology aspires to empower governments, cultural organizations, and technologists to preserve and share the world’s cultural heritage effectively while fostering innovation and collaboration.
